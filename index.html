<p>I'm Alec Ketterer. I'm majoring in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). I previously graduated from Southwestern Illinois College (SWIC) with an Associate in Science degree in 2021. I'm passionate about combing problem-solving with creativity--whether through mathematical research, web development, or designing learning tools for personal projects. One example is MathQuest, a gamified math platform I developed as a class project, which earned strong feedback. I haven't published these projects yet, but I plan to organize and upload them to GitHub once they're properly set up. If you're interested, I'm happy to share code samples or walk through my projects privately.</p>
